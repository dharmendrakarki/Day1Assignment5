    <h3>Common elements</h3>
        <p>
      The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be
      grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American
      football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby
      league, <br />
      where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or
      thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic
      football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where
      handling is strictly <br />
      limited.
    </p>
    <p>Common rules among the sports include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that
        have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
      </li>
      <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="">Scoring goals</a> or points by moving the ball to an opposing
        team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
      </li>
      <li>
        Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two
        goalposts.
      </li>
      <li>The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.</li>
      <li>Players using only their body to move the ball.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all codes, common skills include <a href="">passing</a>,
      <a href="">tackling</a>, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[11] In
      most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside,
      and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a
      crossbar between the goalposts.
